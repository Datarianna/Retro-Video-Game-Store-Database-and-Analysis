# Video Game Store Database and Analysis
## Introduction and Problem Statement
Nostalgia Cave is a retail store that primarily sells retro and contemporary video games, consoles, and accessories. As the store approaches its sixth month of business, the owner is realizing that there are issues with tracking transactions and customer purchase history. The owner has primarily been typing transaction information in spreadsheets, which has been made data on their business disorganized, inaccurate, and hard to gather insights from.

To tackle these challenges, I will be using MySQL to create a database that accurately tracks all sales transactions and customer purchase history, as well as run queries that will gather meaningful information about the business. Then, I will be utilizing Python modules such as Pandas, and Matplotlib to calculate statistical analyses on the data. Lastly, a dashboard will be created for managers so that they can visually see the performance of their company.

## Software Used
- LucidChart for creating the ER Diagram
- MySQL: for creating the database and querying
- Python Pandas Matplotlib, Seaborn: for data cleaning, manipulation, and visualization
- Jupyter Notebook: for coding process
- Tableau and Microsoft Power BI For interactive dashboard
