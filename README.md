# Retro Video Game Store Database and Analysis
## Introduction and Problem Statement
Nostalgia Cave is a retail store that primarily sells many retro and contemporary video games, consoles, and accessories

As the store approaches its sixth month of business, the owner is realizing that there are issues with tracking transactions and customer history. 

there are several challenges happening that are affecting the business and operations of Nostalgia Cave, such as:
1. Inventory and sales transactions not being tracked properly, making it hard to understand customer preferences and behavior.
2. Constantly having to change prices for products since their demand fluctuates a lot.
3. Sourcing inventory; since many retro games are no longer being produced, there is very limited supply in them and Nostalgia Cave must rely on collectors and online marketplaces to add to their inventory. 

To tackle these challenges, I will be using MySQL to create a database that accurately tracks all sales transactions and customer purchase history, as well as run queries that will gather meaningful information about the business.
Then, I will be utilizing Python modules such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to calculate statistical analyses on the data.
Lastly, a dashboard will be created for managers so that they can visually see the performance of their company.

## Software Used
- MySQL: for creating the database
- Python Pandas Matplotlib, Seaborn: for data cleaning, manipulation, and visualization
- Jupyter Notebook: for coding process
- Tableau: For interactive dashboard
